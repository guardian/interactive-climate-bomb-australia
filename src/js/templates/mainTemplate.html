					<p>He is a strong man, Adrian Burragubba: stocky with a white beard and a shock of thick hair. His people, the Wangan and Jagalingou, have called this home for tens of thousands of years.</p>

					<p>When the white man first came here in his great-grandfather's time, Burragubba, 54, a tribal elder and 'law man', says they were thought of as ghosts - strange, but welcome enough. But later generations were to bear the brunt of the interlopers' greed. His grandfather and his father were both removed from the land and put on church-run properties to make way for a gold rush.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Those places were was like concentration camps,&rdquo; he explains. They wanted Aboriginal people out of the way, so you couldn&rsquo;t leave them. The police would take you back if you did.&rdquo;</p>
					<a name="chapter1-2" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>

					<p>Now the father of six fears the current generation of around 400 will lose these ancestral lands to rapacious outsiders. Massive mining operations are looking to plunder a gigantic new coal frontier here in the Galilee Basin. The area at risk is 247,000 square kilometres: or, put it context, the size of Britain. And will these companies succeed? &ldquo;Over my dead body,&rdquo; says Burragubba.</p>

					<p>He points at the sunbaked vista and explains: &ldquo;This level of mining would devastate this land beyond recognition. It would destroy any sense of connection to the land. We are afraid of being wiped out completely.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;All memory of our tribe will be erased forever due to mining. If we can&rsquo;t maintain what our forefathers gave us, we will become non-existent. It will be a barren wasteland, cultural genocide.&rdquo;   We are next to Wolfgang&rsquo;s Peak, a volcanic rock Burragubba describes as 'our Uluru' and he explains how it was created from a rainbow serpent falling from the sky and crashing to the ground. He hopes its name, derived from a white explorer, will be officially changed one day. Burrgubba says: &ldquo;We talk about yumba, which is not just where you live. It&rsquo;s where you began, the locus of your creation.</p><a name="chapter1-4" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>

					<p>&ldquo;British law, Australian law &ndash; we can&rsquo;t identify with that. We simply go along with it because we have to obey it, but our law is permanent. &ldquo;Mining disrupts the practicing of our law. This is our world, and if that ceases to exist, we will perish.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>And it is, of course, not only the Aboriginal way of life is under threat. The Great Barrier Reef, one of the most precious ecosystems on earth, will be in jeopardy because of a major new port has to be built to allow eye-popping increases in exports, and the rise in global warming by burning the coal will hit it too. More, those greenhouse gas emissions mean the world's climate will be in grave danger. </p>

					<p>This is the AS$16.5bn Carmichael project (correct re money?), set to be the first and largest of six (seven?) huge mines planned for the Galilee Basin. Adani, an Indian firm, is behind Carmichael, due to launch in 2017. Environmentalists have launched two court actions (this OK?) to halt Carmichael, and believe the other mines will be less viable if they can win at the first attempt.</p><a name="chapter1-6" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>

					<p>At capacity, the Galilee Basin would ship around 330m tonnes of coal a year to India and China, more than doubling Australia&rsquo;s current coal exports. Little wonder, perhaps, that Tony Abbott, the prime minister, has praised coal for being &ldquo;good for humanity&rdquo;, providing much-needed electricity abroad and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in taxes at home.</p>
					<a name="chapter1-7" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>

					<p>But the greenhouse gas emissions from the burned coal could top 700m tonnes. (is that a total figure if it's all dug up and burned?) If it were a country, the Galilee Basin would be the seventh largest contributor of carbon dioxide in the world, just behind Germany. This makes it a so-called carbon bomb, one of 14 fossil fuel planned excavations around the world which would increase greenhouse gas emissions by one-fifth (correct?)</p>

					<p>Here, in parched Queensland, water is precious. The mine (is this just Carmichael or Galilee in general?)) will require a peak of 12.5 billion litres a year. In some places, the water table will drop by 50m. That is a major threat to Bruce Currie, who has 1400 cattle at his Speculation Farm, close to the southernmost proposed mines &ndash; the Kevin&rsquo;s Corner and Alpha projects.</p>
					<a name="chapter2-2" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>

					<p>Both mines will be operated by GVKHancock, a consortium of Indian mining power and the company headed by Gina Rinehart, the richest woman in Australia. The company says it has conducted extensive studies which show the mines will have no major impact upon groundwater. In any case, there are &ldquo;make good&rdquo; agreements with nearby landholders to remedy any problems.</p>
					<a name="chapter2-3" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>
					<img src="@@assetPath@@/imgs/small-map-test.png">

					<p>But Currie, a father of five, says he is &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; of the consortium's insistence. He is going through a lengthy legal process. (what is it? To stop the mine?). He says: &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t have water supplies for us and our cattle, it will destroy our business, basically. The old saying out here is you can live a long time without love but you can&rsquo;t live long without water.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Currie, who reads Confucius in his spare time, ran as an independent candidate at the last state election, railing against the influence mining firms have over the main political parties and what he feels is an increasingly throwaway society. &ldquo;I was flogged,&rdquo; he recalls.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Mining is unsustainable. They are getting to get a few limited royalties to pay for this nation&rsquo;s debt. It would be responsible to move as quickly as we can now to renewable energy, rather than wait until our resources are depleted and we destroy other productive industries.&rdquo;</p>
					<a name="chapter2-5" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>
					<p>Tim Kirkwood, who runs a cattle station about 60km from the Carmichael mine, near Clermont, disagrees.The rail line that will transport the coal to port slices through his property, with a further area taken up by a new quarry. He believes the mine is vital to Australia's way of life.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;You can be a greenie about these things, but those people generally think food comes from Woolworths,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t realise that you need primary materials for things. They probably think their iPhones are created by Apple out of thin air. Mining and agriculture have always been the primary industries of Australia and always will be. Without them, we&rsquo;ll be in big trouble.&rdquo;   Rob Williams, who works as an electrician, says: &ldquo;How can it hurt? It&rsquo;s got to be good. There&rsquo;s lots of habitat out there for wildlife. Koalas and kangaroos &ndash; they learn to adapt. I work in the workshop and birds fly in there all the time. Wildlife adapts to mining, so people should do, too.&rdquo;   A few hundred kilometres to the east, attitudes are rather less sanguine.</p>

					<p>Tourism operators and green groups laid siege to the plans to expand the Abbot Point port, involving the excavation of five million tonnes of seabed, with the sediment dumped in the reef&rsquo;s waters, potentially smothering corals and seagrasses considered vital for fish, turtles and dugongs. Following an outcry that was echoed by Unesco, the government (Aussie/Queensland?) backed down. The sediment will now be placed upon land.</p><a name="chapter3-2" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>

					<p>Corals are extremely sensitive to changes in water temperature and can die off if they warm too much. Ocean acidification, the change in the water&rsquo;s chemistry when it absorbs CO2, is also a major threat, as it makes it harder for corals to form their skeletons. The reef has lost half of its coral over the past 30 years &ndash; cyclones, pollution, a plague of coral-eating starfish are to blame. Scientists fret that unchecked global warming will irreversibly ravage the ecosystem.   Terry Hughes, head of coral reef research at James Cook University, (where? ) says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite clear from the evidence that the stressors on the reef are too high. The reef is struggling to cope with the current level of pollution, fishing and global warming. I have no doubt the Galilee Basin will damage the Great Barrier Reef. The uncertainty is over the extent. Turning around the trajectory of the reef is like turning around the Titanic. It&rsquo;s no easy task, and opening up the Galilee Basin is loading the dice against a recovery.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Tony Fontes arrived in Airlie Beach, near the Whitsunday islands, in 1978. He&rsquo;d done some diving back home in California. Nothing prepared him for what he saw on the world&rsquo;s largest reef system.</p>
					<a name="chapter3-5" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>
					<p>&ldquo;It was mind blowing. I saw things you just dream of being next to such as manta rays, twice as big as me,&rdquo; Fontes says, stretching his arms wide. &ldquo;After a while you notice the small things too, like sea slugs, which are like the butterflies of the sea. Finding them is like finding a nugget of gold.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Fontes began to worry about the reef in 1998, when there was a mass bleaching event. Another followed in 2002. Bleaching is a process where corals turn bright white and die due to heat stress.</p>
					<a name="chapter3-6" data-type="video" data-mobile-alt="bob"></a>
					<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful but very unhealthy,&rdquo; Fontes says. &ldquo;Corals are generally autumn colours &ndash; browns, greens, greys. But when they are bleached they are the brightest snow while. Dazzling. Really pretty. But then after a few weeks it becomes yucky, very squishy, and then the corals are gone.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Of his dozen favourite dive sites, half are no longer worth the trip because the corals have died. Water visibility has shrunk too &ndash; Fontes says if the wind blows a certain way the water turns a ruddy brown colour.</p>

					<p>The northern portion of the reef has fared much better than the southern, more developed part. It is still an exquisite ecological gem. But the disappearance of the corals has cascading effects, from the small fish that hide in the nooks and crannies to the sharks that feed upon those fish. Unesco&rsquo;s world heritage committee will decide next month whether to officially list the reef as &ldquo;in danger.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Fontes wants people to get up in arms over climate change as they did over the sea dumping. He admits it will be harder this time around.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;We need to mobilise, but climate change is too nebulous, plus you&rsquo;re taking on the coal industry,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many friends in that other than green groups and tourism is loathed to be associated with green groups. But the coal needs to stay in the ground and the Great Barrier Reef can be the spearhead. If we are going to lose it due to climate change, people will say &lsquo;no, we&rsquo;re not going to let that happen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
